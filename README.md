# OTP Authentication System using Blockchain Technology

## üîê Overview

This project is a **decentralized One-Time Password (OTP) authentication system** that leverages blockchain technology for secure, tamper-proof, and transparent user authentication. It eliminates centralized storage vulnerabilities by storing OTP hashes on a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum or a private chain) and verifying OTPs through smart contracts.

## üöÄ Features

* ‚úÖ OTP generation and verification
* üîó Blockchain-based OTP hash storage
* üîê Immutable verification with smart contracts
* üåê Web frontend (React/Flutter/dApp) for user interface
* ‚öôÔ∏è Backend (Node.js/Python/Go) for OTP generation and transaction signing
* üìú Solidity smart contract for OTP validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/otp-blockchain-auth.git
cd otp-blockchain-auth
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Smart Contract

```bash
cd smart-contract
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## üß™ Usage

### 1. Start Local Blockchain

```bash
cd smart-contract
npx hardhat node
```

### 2. Deploy Smart Contract

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### 3. Run Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

### 4. Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **OTP Generation:** A temporary OTP is generated on the backend.
2. **Hashing:** OTP is hashed and stored on the blockchain via a smart contract.
3. **User Entry:** User enters the OTP in the frontend.
4. **Verification:** Frontend hashes the OTP and calls the smart contract to verify it against the stored hash.
5. **Result:** Smart contract returns true/false based on match.

## üìÑ Smart Contract Example

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract OTPAuth {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bytes32) public otpHashes;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function storeOTP(address user, bytes32 otpHash) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can store OTP");
        otpHashes[user] = otpHash;
    }

    function verifyOTP(address user, string memory otp) public view returns (bool) {
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(otp)) == otpHashes[user];
    }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

* OTP never stored in plaintext
* OTP hash is immutable on-chain
* Only admin can write OTP hashes to the contract
